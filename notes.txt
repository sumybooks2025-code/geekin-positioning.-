Notes on CSS Practice and Responsive Design
===========================================

1. Responsive Design
-------------------
Responsive design is the approach of making a website or app layout adapt to different screen sizes and devices. 
Key concepts I practiced:
- Media queries: Using `@media` to apply styles based on device width (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
  Example:
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
        .card {
            width: 100%;
        }
    }
- Flexible units: Using %, em, rem instead of fixed px for margins, paddings, and font sizes.
- Mobile-first approach: Designing for smaller screens first, then adding styles for larger screens.
- Testing layouts across multiple screen sizes to ensure content adjusts properly.

2. Challenges Faced
------------------
While practicing, I encountered a few challenges:
- Differentiating CSS selectors: 
    - Element selector (e.g., `p { }`) targets all tags of that type.
    - Class selector (e.g., `.card { }`) targets all elements with the class.
    - ID selector (e.g., `#header { }`) targets a single unique element.
- Understanding the specificity of CSS rules and why some styles override others.
- Linking CSS properly to HTML and structuring files/folders for a clean project.
- Aligning elements using flexbox and grid, especially when the layout changes for mobile vs desktop.

3. What I Understand Better Now
--------------------------------
After practicing, I have a clearer understanding of:
- How CSS selectors work and how to apply them efficiently.
- How to structure a responsive layout using media queries and flexible units.
- The importance of testing across devices to ensure a consistent user experience.
- Organizing project files: separating HTML, CSS, and images for better maintainability.
- Using CSS properties like padding, margin, border, width, and height to control the box model effectively.
