Notes on CSS Practice and Positioning Design
===========================================

1. CSS Positioning and Layout
-----------------------------
Positioning design is about controlling where elements appear on a web page and how they relate to each other.  
Key concepts I practiced:
- **CSS Positioning Types:**
    - `static` – default positioning, elements follow normal flow.
    - `relative` – element moves relative to its normal position.
    - `absolute` – element positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
    - `fixed` – element stays in place even when scrolling.
    - `sticky` – element toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll.
- **Box Model:** Using width, height, padding, margin, and border to control spacing and alignment.
- **Flexbox:** Aligning elements horizontally and vertically, distributing space between items.
- **Grid Layout:** Organizing elements into rows and columns for structured layouts.
- **Z-Index:** Controlling stacking order for overlapping elements.

2. Challenges Faced
------------------
While practicing, I encountered a few challenges:
- Differentiating CSS positioning types and knowing when to use each.
- Combining Flexbox and Grid for complex layouts.
- Understanding how `z-index` and stacking context affect overlapping elements.
- Aligning elements properly across different sections of the page.
- Linking CSS correctly and maintaining organized file/folder structure.

3. What I Understand Better Now
--------------------------------
After practicing, I have a clearer understanding of:
- How different positioning types affect element flow and layout.
- How to align and distribute elements using Flexbox and Grid.
- Controlling spacing and layout using the box model effectively.
